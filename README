# 👋 Hi!

## 🌊 I just finish building the MVP of Kunami

I'm creating **Kunami** - an AI business strategist for technical founders who can build anything but struggle to figure out *what* to build and *why* it matters.

### The Problem
Most technical founders spend months building solutions looking for problems. They skip market validation, ignore positioning, and wonder why their great product doesn't sell.

### What Kunami Does
Multi-agent AI that validates your business idea through dialogue:

- ✅ **Real Problem Test** - Is anyone actually suffering from this?
- 💰 **Willingness to Pay** - Will they open their wallets?
- 🎯 **Unique Value** - What makes you different from competitors?
- 📍 **Positioning** - How do you own a category?

No generic advice. No template responses. Just honest, evidence-based strategic clarity.

At the end - export the blueprint of your strategy with suggestions of next steps.
